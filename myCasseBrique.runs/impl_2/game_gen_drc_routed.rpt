2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Objects/monostable_inst/impulse_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Objects/monostable_inst/impulse_reg_i_1/O, cell Objects/monostable_inst/impulse_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net an6_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin an6_reg/L3_2/O, cell an6_reg/L3_2 (in an6_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net an6_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin an6_reg_i_2/O, cell an6_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net an7_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin an7_reg/L3_2/O, cell an7_reg/L3_2 (in an7_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ca_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ca_reg/L3_2/O, cell ca_reg/L3_2 (in ca_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cd_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cd_reg/L3_2/O, cell cd_reg/L3_2 (in cd_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ce_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ce_reg/L3_2/O, cell ce_reg/L3_2 (in ce_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cf_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cf_reg/L3_2/O, cell cf_reg/L3_2 (in cf_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cg_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cg_reg/L3_2/O, cell cg_reg/L3_2 (in cg_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
